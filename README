This RESTFUL API enables business owners and public institutions to setup a virtual waiting queues for their customers.
Worked with a NO SQL database. Used Mongodb Atlas to provision a mongodb cluster and access it from the API.
Worked with Token Based Authentication and Role Based Authorization. (Jwt Bearer Tokens)
Implemented a repository pattern.
Worked with the built in DI tools offered by microsoft.
Used postman for testing, used collection variables and code snippets to automate token collection and assignment to collection variables.
Used Docker to containerize the web service and host it on Heroku.
Make sure to adjust the connections string in the startup file (Or program file if sdk>5) to your local or cloud based Mongodb cluster. 
This project uses repository pattern allowing it to be flexible in terms of the type of database chosen ect so feel free to play around with it.
